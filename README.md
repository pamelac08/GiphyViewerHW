### Project Description:

An application utilizing the Giphy API:

* the application uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the users choice and uses JavaScript and jQuery to update the HTML
* an initial choice of buttons is displayed for the user to select to add gifs to the page
* there is also an input field for the user to add topic buttons to enable additional topics to be selected to display gifs
* the gifs are initially displayed statically, when the user clicks once, the gif animates, another click makes the gif static again
* each gif includes the name and rating
* users can request an additional 10 gifs to the page for the current topic chosen
* a user can delete a topic button using the small x button in the upper right corner of the corresponding topic button
